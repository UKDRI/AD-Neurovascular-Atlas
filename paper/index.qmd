## Summary

The neurovascular unit (NVU) is crucial for brain homeostasis and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.
We developed a method to isolate the NVU from parenchymal tissue in post-mortem human brains, achieving over 90% vascular cell enrichment.
Using single-nuclei sequencing from 40 samples (20 control and 20 AD cases), we identified risk associations with AD in pericyte and perivascular fibroblast subtypes, as well as in activated microglia.
These cells have unique risk signatures linked to amyloid, suggesting a collaborative role in AD risk.
Additionally, we discovered EndoMT cells, transitioning from endothelial to mural cells, not previously documented in vascular atlases.
This study provides a valuable resource for understanding NVU composition and dynamics in AD, highlighting potential cellular targets for therapeutic intervention and offering new insights into the cellular interactions associated with amyloid and AD risk.

Panel A is a cartoon of the isolation method. Panel B and C are UMAP plots showing the cells from the vascular/parenchymal fractions and the celltype annotation respectively."}

-   Explain isolation (or refer to pre-print if it's ready?)
-   The quality/purity of the enrichment
-   The cohort details/summary?
-   Celltype annotation?

### Risk section summary

-   TODO:
  -   Run the level 1 celltypes through the PPI/GO/MPO analysis

![](05_figures/990_shared_figures/003_final_figures/figure2.png){#fig-risk fig-alt="A multi-panel figure about Alzheimer's disease risk enrichment."}

-   Analysing Alzheimer's disease celltype-specific risk with the latest Bellenguez AD GWAS shows a significant enrichment of activated microglia, a pericyte subtype and a perivascular fibroblast subtype.[@bellenguez2022]
-   The prior Kunkle GWAS and Bellenguez without the UKBioBank proxy cases (note in the case of the Bellenguez I lost over half the SNPs in the translation to dbSNP rs IDs, dunno what effect keeping them would have...) do not show the same enrichment.[@kunkle2019]
-   GO terms: running GO on the sig magma genes shows amyloid pathways in all three celltypes and regulation of t-cells in microglia/perictye2

### Identification of Risk Associations in Specific Cell Types

We sought to understand what celltype-specific AD risk associations would emerge with a fuller representation of celltypes in the brain.
Using single-nuclei sequencing data, we investigated the association of gene expression profiles in various cell types with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk.
Our analysis identified significant risk associations in three specific cell types: microglia-A, pericyte-2, and perivascular-FB-2.

### MAGMA Analysis

To determine these associations, we employed Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) against the latest Bellenguez AD Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).[@bellenguez2022] The results revealed significant associations for activated microglia (microglia-A), pericyte-2, and perivascular-FB-2.
Microglia-A, which play a crucial role in immune response within the brain, exhibited a pronounced association with AD risk.
pericyte-2, involved in blood-brain barrier maintenance and cerebral blood flow regulation, also showed significant associations.
Similarly, perivascular-FB-2, essential for the structural integrity of the blood-brain barrier and extracellular matrix composition, were identified as significantly associated with AD risk.

#### Conditional Analysis

We conducted conditional analysis to assess the independence of the risk signals.
The results showed significant enrichment for each of the three cell types even when conditioned on the other two cell types, indicating that the observed signals are unique and not confounded by the other cell types.

#### Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis

To further understand the biological implications of these associations, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the significant genes identified by MAGMA for each of the aforementioned cell types.
The GO analysis revealed several enriched pathways, prominently featuring amyloid-related processes.
The enrichment of genes involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, amyloid-beta (Aβ) formation, and amyloid plaque clearance was particularly notable.
This finding aligns with the well-established role of amyloid pathology in AD.
Additionally, for microglia-A and pericyte-2 cell types, significant GO terms related to T-cell and lymphocyte regulation were identified, suggesting an immune regulatory component in AD risk.

#### Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks

We constructed protein-protein interaction networks for the significant genes identified in each cell type.
The PPI networks were significant, and subsequent Louvain clustering of these networks revealed modules associated with amyloid-related processes across all three cell types.
This suggests a coordinated risk association involving amyloid processing among microglia-A, pericyte-2, and perivascular-FB-2.

#### Mouse Ontology Data Analysis

To further validate our findings, we used mouse ontology data to investigate the functional implications of the significant genes.
For microglia-A, significant associations were found with abnormal cell chemotaxis and hematoma.
pericyte-2 showed significant associations with amyloidosis and tau protein deposits.
However, no significant associations were identified for perivascular-FB-2.

#### Interpretation

The identification of these specific cell types and the enrichment of amyloid-related processes underscore the complex interplay between various cellular components in the brain and AD pathology.
Microglia-A, pericyte-2, and perivascular-FB-2 may contribute to disease mechanisms through their roles in immune response, vascular integrity, and amyloid processing, respectively.
The independence of these signals, as shown by conditional analysis, highlights the unique contributions of each cell type.
Additionally, the PPI network analysis suggests a coordinated risk association involving amyloid-related processes across these cell types.
Mouse ontology data further supports these findings, particularly highlighting the roles of microglia-A and pericyte-2 cells in AD-related pathologies.

These findings provide new insights into potential cellular targets for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease.

### Experimental model and study participant details

#### Post-mortem tissue donors

```{r}
n_males <- sum(donor_metadata$sex == "M")
n_females <- sum(donor_metadata$sex == "F")
median_age <- median(donor_metadata$age)
age_range <- range(donor_metadata$age)
```

-   Need to add sex info

Post-mortem pre-frontal cortex from 20 controls and 20 AD brain donors were collected from `brain bank here` under `ethics details here`.
The clinicopathological parameters were collected and summarized in @tbl-donor-metadata, including gender, age, diagnosis, APOE status, ethnicity and Braak stage.
3 donors where excluded in QC and of the remaining `{r} nrow(donor_metadata)` donors, `{r} n_females` were female and `{r} n_males` were male with a median age of `{r} median_age` (range `{r} age_range[1]`-`{r} age_range[2]`).
Sex and age were included as a covariates in pseudobulk differential gene expression analysis.

### Method details

#### Sample prep/neurovascular unit isolation

#### RNA sequencing

### Quantification and statistical analysis

#### Data Processing

The raw sequencing data was processed using CellRanger (version 7.1.0, 10X Genomics), which performed initial alignment, filtering, barcode counting, and UMI counting.
An updated reference genome (Ensembl version 109 and Gencode version 43 annotations for GRCh38) was generated for use with CellRanger.
The resulting gene-barcode matrices were then further processed using the scFlow pipeline implemented in Nextflow.[@khozoie2021 ;@ditommaso2017]

#### Quality Control

The processed data were read into R (version 4.4.0) using the Seurat package (version 5.1.0).[@base; @Seurat] Basic quality control (QC) measures were applied to ensure data integrity and reliability.
Specifically, cells with low feature counts were filtered out, and donors with an insufficient number of high-quality cells were excluded from further analysis, resulting in 3 donors being excluded (both fractions).
The criteria for low feature counts and donor exclusion were determined based on established thresholds in the literature and empirical distributions observed in the data.

#### Cell Type Annotation

Cell types were annotated based on canonical marker genes identified from the literature, @yang2022 in particular.
The expression levels of these marker genes were used to classify cells into distinct cell types.
This annotation process was validated by comparing the identified cell types to known cell type distributions in similar datasets.
