abstract: |
  The neurovascular unit (NVU) underpins critical brain functions by integrating vascular cells, neurons, and glia to maintain metabolic support and blood–brain barrier integrity. Despite mounting evidence implicating vascular dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the contribution of vascular cell types remains underexplored. To address this gap, we analysed a comprehensive prefrontal cortex single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset of AD patients and controls. Our high-resolution atlas, capturing major vascular and parenchymal cell types, reveals distinct associations of AD genetic risk with pericyte-, perivascular fibroblast-, and activated microglia-specific gene expression profiles. 
  Functional analyses show that the genes driving these associations converge on amyloid-related pathways, implicating perivascular compartments and immune modulators in the early stages of AD pathobiology. Furthermore, we identify an endothelial-mesenchymal transition population that is diminished in AD. This transitional population appears to be an intermediary between endothelial cells and mural cells, suggesting a disruption in endothelial plasticity that may underlie vascular dysfunction in AD. We also found markedly dysregulated key ligand–receptor interactions between cell types, including ANGPT2, highlighting specific targets that could drive NVU breakdown in AD.
  Taken together, our neurovascular atlas reveal novel links between vascular dynamics and AD pathogenesis focused on protecting and restoring the brain's neurovascular interface.

# Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent type of dementia, is pathologically hallmarked by extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neurodegeneration.
The brain's microvasculature is the interface between blood and brain and plays a crucial role in AD pathophysiology.
It serves as a barrier (the blood-brain-barrier, BBB) [@cai2018; @nehra2022] preventing harmful substances, such as toxins and pathogens, from entering the central nervous system.
The BBB regulates the transport of essential nutrients and aids in the removal of waste products thereby maintaining the brain's stable environment, essential for proper neural function.
This is achieved through specialized vascular cells, including brain endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells.
The concept of the neurovascular unit (NVU) emphasizes the intimate relationship between brain parenchymal and vascular cells, for example by ensuring sufficient supply of oxygen and glucose to meet the metabolic demands of neurons and glia [@Iadecola2017].

ECs contribute to the clearance of Aβ and other toxins, regulate the exclusion of harmful blood proteins, and facilitate immune cell trafficking [@Zhang2022; @Daneman2015; @Amersfoort2022].
Both ECs and pericytes (PCs) are essential for maintaining brain perfusion, endothelial permeability, and immune activation [@Brown2019; @Procter2021].
Evidence from imaging, neuropathological studies, and preclinical models indicates chronic tissue hypoxia, impaired cerebral blood flow regulation, and BBB integrity loss in early AD stages, often linked to increased Aβ levels [@Nehra2022; @Korte2020].
Knowledge of cell-type specific gene expression has transformed the interpretation of AD genetic risk and our understanding of AD molecular pathology [@mcquade2019; @yang2023].

We analysed 80 paired vascular/parenchymal single-nucleus RNA sequencing samples from prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue of 20 Alzheimer's disease and 20 control donors, generated through the IMI IM2PACT project (GEO accessions: GSE310554 & GSE222007), which aimed to characterise the human neurovascular unit.
By constructing a high-resolution atlas with strong representation of both parenchymal and vascular cell types, we identified significant enrichment of AD genetic risk in pericytes, perivascular fibroblasts, and activated microglia, implicating these cell types in amyloid-related pathways and suggesting their involvement in early AD pathobiology.
Strikingly, we discovered a transitional endothelial-mesenchymal (EndoMT) population expressing both endothelial and mural cell markers, which we validated in both human and mouse brain.
This population was markedly reduced in AD, pointing to impaired endothelial plasticity as a novel axis of disease vulnerability.
Furthermore, integrative analysis of ligand-receptor signaling revealed dysregulation of angiopoietin-TEK pathways, highlighting perturbed vascular stabilisation signals as a potential mechanism linking vascular dysfunction to neurodegeneration.
Together, these findings provide new insights into the neurovascular unit in AD and establish a valuable data resource for dissecting vascular contributions to neurodegeneration.

# Results

## A single cell atlas of the neurovascular unit

The single nuclei RNA sequencing dataset was obtained via the IM2PACT consortium [https://im2pact.org](https://im2pact.org) from prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples of 40 individuals, captured on 10x chips, divided into 20 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cases and 20 controls (@fig-umap A) (GEO accessions: GSE310554 & GSE222007).
For each individual, two fractions were available: vascular and parenchymal, both obtained from the same PFC tissue.
Hence there was a total of 80 nuclei fractions (40 vascular and 40 parenchymal) with 474,357 nuclei in total.
This was subset to `{r} scales::comma(num_cells_post_qc)` nuclei after quality control (QC) and three donors were also removed (See @sec-seq-qc for QC details).
The median number of genes whose expression was detected per nucleus was `{r} scales::comma(median_features_post_qc)` post-QC.
Nuclei were annotated into `{r} level1_celltypes_n` main cell types which were further subdivided into `{r} scales::comma(level2_celltypes_n)` subtypes based on published markers (@fig-umap & @suppfig-level1-markers)[@yang2022; @mathys2023].

The data provides excellent coverage of all four major vascular cell types (endothelial, pericyte, smooth muscle cell (SMC), fibroblasts) and their neighboring parenchymal cells (astrocytes, microglia, excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC)).
As expected, cell types were detected in their appropriate vascular or parenchymal fractions, with for example \>95% of endothelial cells coming from the vascular fraction and \>95% of neurons from the parenchymal fraction.
Certain cell types were present in both fractions, including microglia and T cells.
The two most abundant nuclei were from oligodendrocytes captured in the parenchymal fraction and endothelial cells captured in the vascular fraction.
Oligodendrocytes represented \~28% of the total nuclei and endothelial were \~20%.
We contrasted the number of nuclei analysed from the vascular fractions of this study to the recent Yang et al. and Tsartsalis et al. papers via a chi-squared test and find significantly more nuclei for all cell types present in all studies, excluding fibroblasts contrasted with Yang et al. which are on par (Bonferroni adjusted P \< 0.05, @fig-umap E).
Conversely, we identified over ten times the mean number of neurons per sample[@yang2022].

## Activated microglia, pericytes, perivascular fibroblasts and T cells are enriched for AD risk genes focused on amyloid processing and immune cell activation

Having a more complete picture of the parenchymal and vascular fractions of the PFC enables a more accurate definition of gene cell-type-specificity, through which we sought to more definitively understand which cell types were associated with the genetic risk of AD.
We employed Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) along with the latest Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) for AD[@bellenguez2022] testing the top 10% of genes most specifically expressed within each cell type amongst nuclei from control individuals (see @sec-method-risk).
Amongst the 12 main cell types, our analysis identified microglia, fibroblasts, pericytes, and T-cells associated with AD genetic risk (@suppfig-risk-level1).
While microglia have been implicated previously with AD genetic risk, the associations with with other cell types are novel.

Further analysis at the subtype level, implicated, in particular, activated microglia (Microglia A), pericyte-2 and perivascular fibroblast 2 (FB-2) with AD genetic risk (@fig-risk A).
Furthermore there was significant enrichment for each of the three cell types even when conditioned on the other two cell types (@fig-risk B), indicating that the observed signals are uniquely associated with a cell type and not confounded through shared gene expression across cell types (@fig-risk C).
To further understand the biological implications of the AD genetic risk genetic associations, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on those genes identified by MAGMA as contributing to that cell subtype's AD risk association.
The GO analysis revealed several enriched pathways, prominently featuring several amyloid-related processes.
The enrichment of genes involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, amyloid-beta (Aβ) formation, and amyloid plaque clearance was particularly notable (@fig-risk D).
This finding aligns with the well-established role of amyloid pathology in AD.
Additionally, for activated microglia and pericyte-2 subtypes, significant GO terms related to T-cell and lymphocyte regulation were identified, suggesting an immune regulatory component in AD risk, aligning with the significant risk association of T-cells in the main cell type analysis.

We found significantly (P \< 0.05, @sec-method-ppi) more protein-protein interaction (PPI) amongst the MAGMA genes identified in each cell type than expected by chance demonstrating convergent cell type specific gene AD risk networks.
Subsequent Louvain clustering of these PPI networks revealed distinct modules associated with amyloid-related processes (via further GO enrichment analysis) across all three cell types (@fig-risk F, G, H).
This suggests a convergent risk associated processes involving amyloid processing among activated microglia, pericytes, and perivascular fibroblasts.

Finally, we used the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MPO) to investigate the phenotypes resulting from the knock-out of these genes' 1:1 orthologs in the mouse.
For the activated microglia risk genes, significant associations were found with the abnormal cell chemotaxis and hematoma MPO terms while pericyte-2 risk genes showed significant associations with amyloidosis and tau protein deposits (@fig-risk E).
However, no significant phenotypic associations were identified amongst the mouse orthologues of the perivascular fibroblast risk genes.

## A population of Endothelial Mesenchymal Transitional Cells are detected in human prefrontal cortex whose transition appears disrupted in Alzheimer's Disease

We identified a substantial vascular cell population (16021 nuclei, 10% of vascular fraction), expressing both endothelial and mural cell identity markers (@fig-endomt-prop B) which has not been well-annotated in other single cell datasets of cortical brain tissue.
We hypothesized that this cell population, herein termed endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), may be undergoing endothelial mesenchymal transition and, ultimately, differentiating into mural cells.
A recent single cell RNA-seq study of brain cavernomas and arteriovenous malformations[@bravi2016; @shoemaker2020; @wälchli2024] also reported a brain tissue EndoMT population.
However, we did not identify a significant overlap in their markers with our population (@suppfig-endomt-paper-markers).
Furthermore, subsequent differentiation into brain mural cells has not been previously described suggesting this represents a novel brain population.
Importantly, we find EndoMT in control donor brains indicating that this transitional cell population may represent a normal physiological state.

Upon examining changes in cell-type proportions, we identified a significant ~50% reduction in the proportion of EndoMT cells in AD, with both EndoMT1 and EndoMT2 subtypes being reduced (@fig-endomt-prop A).
We also observed reduced percitye-1 nuclei in AD whereas SMC nuclei were increased (both vascular-SMC-1 and –2) and the most increased cell type was meningeal fibroblasts (@fig-endomt-prop A).
Relatedly, when correlating cell-type proportions across donors, we find a significant and strong negative correlation between endothelial and pericyte/SMC populations (@suppfig-vascular-population-correlations).
This further supports a concept of regulated balance between endothelial cells and mural cells, perhaps via regulation of EndoMT. 
With respect to the parenchymal fraction, as would be expected in a neurodegenerative disorder, there was a significant reduction in excitatory neuron subtypes (Ex-Neuro-1 \~75% reduction; Ex-Neuro-5 \~50% reduction) (@suppfig-parenchymal-prop-diff).

We sought to further validate the EndoMT population and to assess changes in AD by using flow-cytometry to detect cells co-expressing an endothelial cell specific and a mural cell specific nuclear proteins.
We identified ERG as selectively expressed by EC but not mural cells and NOTCH3 which is selectively expressed by mural cells but not EC (@fig-endomt-prop B).
Anti-ERG and Anti-NOTCH3 are widely used as identity markers for endothelial cells and mural cells respectively[@shah2016; @gastfriend2024].
Using 10 independent samples (5 AD and 5 controls), we found 15% of control nuclei but only 10% of AD PFC co-expressed ERG and NOTCH3, confirming a significant reduction of EndoMT cells in AD (@fig-endomt-prop C).

We complimented this validation by performing lineage-tracing using the endothelial-specific Cre mouse line CDH5-Cre coupled to the R26RtdTOMATO (R26RTOM) reporter line to test our hypothesis that EndoMT are an intermediate state between EC and mural cells.
Lineage tracing and staining of endothelial cells with CD31 and pericytes with PDGFRB, both markers used for cell clustering, thereby confirmed that pericytes could arise from endothelial cells (@fig-endomt-prop D/E).

## Distinct transcription factors underlie endothelial to pericyte and vascular smooth muscle trajectories

To understand the molecular basis of these transitions, we performed pseudotime analysis using Slingshot[@Street2018].
This uncovered two primary lineages of EndoMT cells, each characterized by unique transitional subtypes (@fig-endomt A).
Lineage 1 encompasses EC that progress through EndoMT-2 cells toward smooth muscle cells (SMCs), herein named lineage EndoMT-SMC, while Lineage 2 are EC transition to EndoMT-1 cells and then differentiating into pericytes, herein named EndoMT-PC (@fig-endomt B).
The distribution across the trajectory was even across controls and AD, and between males and females (@suppfig-endomt-pca).
This confirms the population captured is a novel and ubiquitous phenomenon.

We used tradeSeq[@Van2020] to understand changes in gene expression through the trajectories in each lineage and potential candidates that may be driving the process.
We focused upon transcription factors diverging in early pseudo-time and thus may be involved in the fate choices.
We identified 8 such transcription factors, including *FOXP2* and *RORA* which were increased with pseudotime in lineage EndoMT-PC but not EndoMT-SMC (@suppfig-endomt-tfs A-B).
Conversely *ZBTB7C*, *PRDM16* and *NR4A1* are increased in lineage EndoMT-SMC (@suppfig-endomt-tfs C-E).
This was corroborated by applying switchDE to each lineage, which identified *FOXP2*/*RORA* and *ZBTB7C*/*NR4A1* to be significant genes in the EndoMT-PC/EndoMT-SMC lineages respectively[@kieran_campbell_aut_switchde_2017].

Using SCENIC[@aibar_scenic_2017], we next identified transcription factor networks underlying each of the vascular cell-subtypes.
As expected of cell-type determinates, there were not differences between AD and control.
However, *FOXP2* was notably enriched in pericyte subtypes whilst *MECOM* was strongly enriched in endothelial and EndoMT cell subtypes (@fig-endomt C). 
Examining the change in expression of transcription factors across pseudotime highlighted *FOXP2* as progressively increasing in pericytes in the EndoMT-PC lineage but not showing any change in the EndoMT-SMC lineage (@fig-endomt D). 
*BCL6* is also interesting since it is a transcriptional repressor and its related protein BLC6b has recently been shown to oppose endothelial cell differentiation[@liBCL6BdependentSuppressionETV22024]. 
Hence its transitory increase may be required to initiate EndoMT.

## Alzheimer's Disease molecular pathology preferentially affects the endothelial to pericyte lineage

To understand how vascular cells and in particular EndoMT are changed in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathophysiology we performed differential gene expression between controls and AD cases focusing on vascular cell types. 
Using Model-based Analysis of Single Cell Transcriptomics (MAST)[@finak2015], we found 610 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the EndoMT-PC but only 8 DEGs in the EndoMT-SMC (@fig-degs A/B & @supptbl-mast-degs). 
The impact of AD on endothelial cell to pericyte transition is further supported by the overlap with tradeSeq identified trajectory genes: 143 of the 410 most significantly differentially expressed genes (P \< $1 \times 10^{-16}$) identified by tradeSeq were overlapping with the significant DEGs identified by MAST in EndoMT-PC (138 genes) and EndoMT-SMC (5 genes) (@supptbl-tradeseq-degs-early, @supptbl-tradeseq-degs-late, @supptbl-tradeseq-degs-lin & @supptbl-tradeseq-degs-cond). 
The strong effect of AD pathology on the pericyte lineage is consistent with our observation of reduced pericytes proportion and other studies that have highlighted early pericyte loss in AD[@winkler2014].

EndoMT-PC DEGs were enriched for the GO terms negative regulation of endothelial cell migration (GO:0010596), protein folding (GO:0006457) and negative regulation of natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity/immunity (GO:0045953/0002716) while there were no significantly enriched pathways for EndoMT-SMC biological processes (@supptbl-mast-go-pathways & @supptbl-mast-go-pathways-filter).
Furthermore, several genes altered in AD have been previously implicated in AD. 
For example, BACE2 is a beta-secratase enzyme which degrades amyloidogenic peptides and reduce plaque formation. 
*BACE2* is progressively downregulated in both lineages but more highly expressed in AD compared to controls in early pseudotime (@suppfig-adriskpseudotime A)[@yeap2022]. 
APOD, involved in lipid transport and neuroprotection, shows a substantial increase at the late stage in both trajectories, but is significantly reduced in AD in EndoMT-PC (@suppfig-adriskpseudotime B)[@bhatia2018]. 
TGF-β1, involved in regulating phagocytic clearance of Aβ by microglia, is also increased in cases for both lineages. 
These three examples highlight genes that are potentially neuroprotective mechanism in AD but given their changes in the EndoMT trajectories may be altered in vascular plasticity processes.

## Blood vessel stabilisation signaling is altered in Alzheimer's Disease

We next examined cell-cell interactions relevant for EndoMT by intersecting tradeSeq differential trajectory genes with significantly altered ligand-receptor (L-R pairs) from CellChat[@Jin2021].
This identified both ANGPT2-TEK and ANGPT1-TEK ligands that destabilize and stabilize blood vessels respectively, as significantly altered ligand-receptor (LR) pairs (@suppfig-cellchat B & @fig-angpt2 D/E).
In AD only, EndoMT-PC and EndoMT-SMC are receivers of the vascular destabilizing ligand ANGPT2 from OPCs through TEK/TIE2 and ITGA5/B5.
The role of ANGPT2 in AD is further supported by tradeSeq with *ANGPT2* significantly upregulated throughout both lineage trajectories and using MAST, significantly upregulated in several cell types, including EndoMT-PC and endothelial subtypes (@fig-angpt2 A/B/C).
*GATA-1* and *ETS-1* have been reported as key regulators of ANGPT2, and both are also significantly upregulated in capillary EC nuclei of AD donors.

Conversely, we find the stabilizing ligand ANGPT1 has the same profile of source-receiver celltypes as ANGPT2, but this is now present only in controls.
For ANGPT1, both EndoMT-PC and EndoMT-SMC receive from astrocytes and inhibitory neurons in AD only, whereas controls only receive from excitatory neurons.
*ANGPT1* is also significantly down regulated in astrocytes in AD via MAST.
These results propose significant alterations in endothelial plasticity and signaling in AD, with altered signaling dynamics through key genes including *ANGPT2* and *ANGPT1*.
The opposite changes we found for ANGPT2 and ANGPT1 is consistent with their opposing functional effects on vessel stability[@wang2017].

## Alzheimer's Disease affects genes involved in protein folding and vascular remodeling

We observed significant effects on vascular cells, beyond just EndoMT-PC, and glial cells.
Confining to the strongest gene expression changes (average log fold change (LFC) \> 1, adjusted P value \< 0.05), capillary and venous EC showed the most changes (@fig-degs A) and these were also among the top four cell types with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) without an LFC cut-off (@fig-degs B).
Most cell types exhibit few significant DEGs, but a subset had many, including quiescent (Q) and activated (A) astrocytes and EndoMT-PC.

We examined GO functional enrichment among the DEGs and in the gene set with LFC \> 1, and summarised the enriched GO biological process terms using REVIGO (@fig-degs C).
Representative REVIGO clusters included response to chemokine, erythrocyte differentiation and cytosolic calcium release were identified across astrocytes, neurons, microglia, endothelial, pericytes and SMCs.
Of note, *ANGPT2* was one genes contributing to the erythrocyte differentiation GO cluster. 
Similarly, *CSF1* was also a gene in this cluster and has been reported to reduce volume and reduce cognitive decline in mice when knocked out[@dagher2015], whereas in humans, increased CSF1 expression has been correlated with plaque burden in post-mortem tissue[@walker2017].
Function enrichment on the broader DEGs (@fig-degs D), again summarised with REVIGO, showed endothelial migration terms across many of the vascular cell types, suggesting changes in genes involved with vascular remodelling in AD[@fisher2022].
However, the most consistent changes across cell types both with and without an LFC cut-off, were in genes involved in protein folding, which is expected given the central role of amyloid and tau protein aggregation in AD.

With respect to cell-cell interactions beyond EndoMT, we observed less interaction between neuronal subtypes in AD, both in number and strength (@suppfig-cellchat A). 
Excitatory neurons strongly communicated with other neuronal subtypes in terms of the numbers of interactions and the strength of interactions in controls, and this was reduced in AD. 
There is also a decrease in the number of neuronal to vascular interactions in AD although the strength of interactions is not as clearly changed. 
These findings are unsurprising for a neurodegenerative disorder. 
More strikingly, there is a decrease in communication between vascular and parenchymal cell types in AD, particularly for EndoMT-SMC, M-pericytes and meningeal-FB to Ex-Neuro-2/6 and In-Neuro-5. 
Conversely, there is more communication between vascular cell types in AD, particularly for pericyte-2 and several perivascular-FB subtypes. 
Hence the cell-cell signaling analysis in our neurovascular dataset reveals the important effects of AD on vascular signaling.

# Discussion

We have undertaken comprehensive neurovascular unit (NVU) analysis of the human prefrontal cortex to better understand complex effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on brain cortical tissue.
We found enrichment of AD risk genes in vascular cells such as pericytes and perivascular fibroblasts.
The identification of these specific cell types and the enrichment of amyloid-related processes underscore the interplay between various cellular components in the brain and AD pathology.
Activated microglia, pericytes, and perivascular fibroblasts may contribute to disease mechanisms through their roles in immune response, vascular integrity, and amyloid processing, respectively.
The independence of these signals, as shown by conditional analysis, highlights the unique contributions of each cell type.

We identify a transitional cell-population, EndoMT, present in control and AD donors with trajectory analysis supporting trans-differentiation of endothelial cells to either pericytes or vascular smooth muscle.
A mesenchymal stem cell-like transition has been described for endothelium, particularly in the heart where they have been proposed to underlie cardiac fibrosis[@zeisberg2007] and may also differentiate into cardiac pericytes and vascular smooth muscle.
In this transition, endothelial cells show degradation of their vascular basement membrane, loss of cell–cell contact, and acquire a migratory phenotype.
There is also loss of expression of specific endothelial markers including VE-Cadherin and gain expression of mesenchymal markers including alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)[@medici2010].

Transforming growth factor-β1 has been previously reported as a key inducer of EndoMT and can promote smooth muscle-like differentiation in pericytes[@verbeek1994].
We also identified transcription factors that may be more important in the brain. 
These factors were differentially expressed along pseudotime, distinguishing the two lineages and separating early from late transition stages.
EndoMT has also been reported to drive the formation of cerebral cavernous malformations[@maddaluno2013].
However in our study, the EndoMT populations are abundant in control donor brain.
Whilst this has been described in the developing heart, our study is the first to suggest this process in adult non-disease brain.
This may therefore represent an important physiological process to dynamically alter and renew mural cell composition in the brain.

The substantial reduction of EndoMT populations in AD implicates vascular plasticity as an under-explored disease vulnerability in AD.
The loss of pericytes in the blood-brain barrier has previously been described in Alzheimer's disease[@winkler2014] and our data suggests this may, at least in part, be a consequence of both perturbed EndoMT differentiation and overall abundance.
The significant reduction in the EndoMT population in AD is presumably driven by endothelial cells failing to differentiate into them, though this requires further validation.
Evaluating whether restoration of the EndoMT population in AD rescues vascular and BBB deficits would be of particular interest, and potentially relevant to other neurodegenerative conditions.
The transcriptional changes observed along these lineages, including dysregulation of key genes such as *BACE2* and *APOD*, reinforce the involvement of AD-related genes in vascular transformations in AD.

Our data provides insights into cell-cell communication in the NVU.
We observed a decrease in overall cell-cell communication between vascular and parenchymal cells in AD highlighting potential disruptions in NVU integrity that warrant further exploration.
Furthermore we identified significant alterations in specific signaling pathways, particularly dysregulated *ANGPT2* and *ANGPT1*, with opposing profiles that align with their established roles in vascular stability.
This is consistent with our previous vascular atlas of AD where we also found increased expression of *ANGPT2* in AD[@tsartsalis2024].
These signaling dynamics provide a mechanistic basis for the observed vascular alterations in AD, suggesting that disruptions in endothelial signaling contribute to NVU dysfunction and subsequent neurodegeneration.
Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ANGPT2 levels correlate with blood-brain barrier leakiness, tau pathology, and neuronal injury in early AD[@vanhulle2024].
Plasma ANGPT2 levels are also higher in AD patients compared to controls[@qin2015].
Our observations of both increased endothelial *ANGPT2* and decreased EndoMT-transitioning propose a fundamental alteration in vascular remodelling within AD, perhaps driven by the vascular inflammation observed[@scholz_angiopoietin-2_2015].
Under this hypothesis, endothelial cells are destabilized by ANGPT2 but subsequent transitioning to mural cells appears retarded resulting in loss of blood-brain barrier integrity.

In conclusion, our data represent a detailed characterization of the NVU in health and disease.
This has revealed previously unappreciated vascular contributions to AD, particularly through novel cellular and molecular insights into EndoMT and its dysregulation.
These findings underscore the importance of vascular plasticity in brain health and highlight the NVU as a promising target for therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative diseases.
Future studies in the role of EndoMT in pathology may yield further insights into the complex interplay of cell types within the human brain.

## Method details

Data was generated and obtained via the IM2PACT consortium [https://im2pact.org](https://im2pact.org) following the protocol described in Tsartsalis et al.2024[@tsartsalis2024].

## EndoMT FACS Analysis

Following isolation of vascular nuclei fractions from the prefrontal cortices of 10 donors (5 AD, 5 control), each sample was stained with DAPI, and blocked with Goat Serum before adding primary antibodies - Anti-ERG (abcam, EPR3864, 10 µg/mL) for endothelial nuclei, and Anti-Notch3 (Invitrogen, PA5-142191, 10 µg/mL) for mesenchymal nuclei - then incubated for 30 minutes on ice.
Subsequently, secondary antibodies were added: Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen, A-21206, 1:) and Donkey anti-Goat IgG AlexaFluor 594 (Invitrogen, A-11058) respectively.

Fluorescence activated sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria III, by sorting nuclei positive for DAPI and either AlexaFluor488, AlexaFluor594, or both.
Following sorting, the .fcs files were imported into Floreada.io for careful adjustment of gating using unstained controls to ascertain the cutoffs for positively stained nuclei.
The endothelial, mesenchymal, and EndoMT populations were identified as proportions of the overall DAPI+ cohort of nuclei, with the EndoMT population defined as those nuclei double-positive for both ERG and Notch3.

## Mouse lineage tracing

### Mouse model

All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the University of South Australia and SJCRH Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.
Mice expressing Cre under the Cdh5 promoter (Cdh5-Cre)[@chen2009] were crossed with Ai14 (Rosa-CAG-LSL-tdTomato-WPRE) mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (#007914)[@madisen2009] to generate Cdh5-Cre; R26-tdTom animals for lineage tracing of endothelial cells.
Genotyping was carried out by Transnetyx (Cordova, TN).
All mice had consistent access to food and water and were housed at ambient temperature (20–25°C) and humidity (40–60%) with 12-h light/12-h dark cycles.

### Immunofluorescence analysis of brain tissue

Whole brains were fixed in 4% PFA, bisected through the midline, cryopresereved in 20% sucrose, mounted and cryosectioned in OCT compound (Cellpath, KMA-0100-00A).
14mm cryosections were dried at room temperature in the dark for 30 minutes and washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich, P2287).
To image endogenous tdTomato fluorescence, sections were incubated with 1 mM DAPI for 10 minutes, washed twice with PBS, and mounted with Prolong Gold (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, P36930).
For immunofluorescence analysis of pericytes and endothelial cells, sections were were blocked in 10% DAKO block, 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, and stained with the indicated primary antibodies.
Antibodies used were rat anti-CD31 (Biolegend) 1:150; goat anti-PDGFRb (R&D technologies) 1:100.
Slides were mounted in Fluoro-mount G with DAPI (ProSciTech).
Confocal images were acquired on a LSM 800 (Zeiss) system.

## Quantification and statistical analysis

### Data Processing

The raw sequencing data was processed using CellRanger (version 7.1.0, 10X Genomics), which performed initial alignment, filtering, barcode counting, and UMI counting.
An updated reference genome (Ensembl version 109 and Gencode version 43 annotations for GRCh38) was generated for use with CellRanger.
The resulting gene-barcode matrices were then further processed using the scFlow pipeline implemented in Nextflow.[@khozoie2021; @ditommaso2017]

### Quality Control {#sec-seq-qc}

The processed data were read into R (version 4.4.0) using the Seurat package (version 5.1.0).[@base; @Seurat] In addition to the filtering performed by scFlow, cells with low feature/RNA counts were filtered out (between \<300 & \<7500 for features and \>1000 for RNA), and donors with an insufficient number of high-quality cells were excluded from further analysis, resulting in 3 donors (both fractions), and the vascular fraction from 1 addition donor being excluded.

### Clustering

A standard Seurat workflow was followed including normalisation, finding variable features, scaling and PCA.
For the UMAP 35 dimensions and a resolution of 0.6 was used.

### Cell Type Annotation

Cell types were annotated based on canonical marker genes identified from the literature, @yang2022 in particular.
The expression levels of these marker genes were used to classify cells into distinct main cell types.
These higher level cell types were then subclustered with 20 dimensions and a resolution of 0.4 to identify cell subtypes.
This annotation process was validated by comparing the identified cell types to known cell type distributions in similar datasets.

### Differences in cell proportions

To analyze differences in cell type proportions between case and control groups, we utilized both the scProportionTest R package (version 0.0.0.9000) and the propeller function from the speckle R package (version 1.4.0) on the vascular and parenchymal fractions separately.[@speckle; @Miller2021] For scProportionTest a permutation test is used to calculate a p-value for each cluster, and a confidence interval for the magnitude difference is returned via bootstrapping.
The speckle method employs a robust linear modelling framework to test for significant differences in cell type proportions across experimental conditions, while accounting for the compositional nature of the data and potential variability between samples.

### MAST differential gene expression

The FindMarkers function from Seurat was used to perform differential gene expression via MAST.
Donor ID, age and sex were included as latent variables.
This was then used to perform hypergeometric GO enrichment analysis by filtering to significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (adjusted p-value \< 0.05) and running `enrichGO` from `clusterProfiler` (version 4.12.0) with all genes identified in this dataset used a background.[@clusterProfiler]

### Mammalian Phenotype Ontology enrichment

We use the Jackson Laboratory Mammalian Phenotype Ontology database[@Smith2009] (release 2024-02-07 ) to test for enrichment of gene lists in phenotypic terms.
Given the directed acyclic graph structure of the ontology, we used Simona[@gu2023] (version 1.0.10) to annotate child (more specific) terms to their ancestors (more general) terms, creating a deeply annotated set.
We further subset the database to terms with more than 10 and less than 200 genes and tested for gene enrichment using an hypergeometric test.
We adjusted the p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to account for multiple testing.

### Cell-cell communication

To investigate cell-cell communication we employed `CellChat` (version 2.1.2).[@CellChat] A `CellChat` object was created for cases and controls separately using the "Secreted Signaling" ligand-receptor interaction database.
A standard `CellChat` was then followed to identify over expressed genes/ligands and contrast these in cases and controls.

### Protein-protein interaction networks {#sec-method-ppi}

We created a combined protein-protein interaction network by combining the following resources: APID[@Alonso-López2019], BIOGRID[@Oughtred2021], BIOPLEX[@Huttlin2021], CORUM[@Tsitsiridis2023], HITPREDICT[@López2015], HuRi[@Luck2020], INTACT[@Orchard2014], MINT[@Licata2012], REACTOME[@Gillespie2022] and only protein physical links from STRING[@Szklarczyk2023].
All datasets were mapped to Ensembl Gene ID from either Entrez, Uniprot or Ensembl Protein IDs using org.Hs.eg.db.
All duplicated and self-interactions were removed.
For any gene set of interest we tested if we observed more interactions than expected by chance.
A 10,000 randomizations were used to obtain an empiric p value, reflecting the number of times that equally sized random samples of genes (with similar degree and gene lenght) had more interactions than our gene set of interest.

### Disease risk enrichment {#sec-method-risk}

To investigate enrichment for disease risk we employed both MAGMA (version 1.10) and LD score (version 1.0.1).[@leeuw2015; @bulik-sullivan2015] We subset to control samples and identified celltype-specific marker genes using `FindAllMarkers` from the Seurat package.[@Seurat-2] Only genes that are detected in a minimum of 25% of cells in either of the two populations are considered and a minimum log fold change of 0.01 were used.
This function was used to apply a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to compare each cluster against all other clusters identifying differentially expressed gene.
From this list of genes, the top ten percent of the total number of genes in the dataset (27459 genes in total) which had the lowest p-values from this test were selected as the celltype specific genes.

The 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 3) was used as a reference in combination with the NCBI37 (GRCh37) genome build as an annotation file.[@auton2015; @sayers2022] Genes were annotated with a window 35Kb and 10Kb up/downstream respectively.
The Bellenguez et al. 2022 AD GWAS was used.[@bellenguez2022]

### Pseudotime analysis

To investigate pseudotime in EndoMT we subset the data to just the endothelial, mural and EndoMT nuclei.
Standard processing as applied to the subset (normalization, feature selection and scaling) via Seurat.
PCA and UMAP were computed with 2 dimensions/PCs respectively and clustering was performed with a resolution of 0.1.
This clustered the endothelial and mural celltypes well, but not the EndoMT, so that was subset and re-clustered with a resolution of 0.02 with the subsequent labels applied to the 2 EndoMT clusters.
The slingshot R package (version 2.12.0) was then applied to the data on the PCA with the endothelial cluster as the starting cluster.
Other clustered were tested as starting clusters, but a linear pseudotime starting from the endothelial cluster fit the data best.
The tradeSeq R package (version 1.18.0) was then applied to identify pseudotemporally differential genes.
As the number of nuclei in the EndoMT clusters was much smaller than the endothelia/mural clusters the data was subsampled to match the size of the smallest EndoMT cluster (1500 nuclei).
Age and sex were added as covariates and 6 knots were used to fit the tradeSeq models.
Functions associationTest, patternTest, earlyDETest, diffEndTest and conditionTest were then used to identify differential genes.
As a large number of genes were found to be significantly differential we choose to focus on the most significant genes by filtering to those with a adjusted P-value of $< 1 \times 10^{-16}$.

SwitchDE was applied to each lineage. 
Cells were subset based on their weight to relevant lineage (> 0.5).
The counts matrix was filtered to these cells and genes expressed in fewer than 20% of cells were also excluded.
