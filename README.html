<h1 id="project-overview">Project overview</h1>
<p>This project is using single-nuclear RNA sequencing data to
investigate the blood brain barrier in Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>There are 20 cases and 20 controls with two cell populations, from
the parenchyma and vascular, sequenced for a total of 80 samples.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>The are three sets of data.</p>
<p>Set 1 contains the first 12 donors, 24 samples (12x P - parenchymal
and 12x V - vascular fraction), which are independently sequenced of
Set_2 (the remaining 16 samples from 8 donors). The sequencing was
performed for set 1 initially in Oxford, but there were some issues with
index hopping and cleaning the data did not seem to work too well. So
Set 1 was re-sequenced in Cardiff and the folder is:
211008_A00748_0157_AHT7TJDSX2_fastq_L2_3_4</p>
<p>For set 2 the data was sequenced initially on one Illumina lane, but
then more lanes were added for better coverage.</p>
<p>The last set is another bath of 40 samples from 20 donors.</p>
<h2 id="processing-of-data">Processing of data</h2>
<p>FastQC/MultiQC were run to assess sequencing quality, no issues were
found with the latest batch of samples. Subsequently standard processing
was done with <a
href="https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest">cellranger</a>,
using an updated reference with Ensembl version 109 and Gencode version
43. The output of this was run through <a
href="https://github.com/combiz/nf-core-scflow/tree/dev-nf">scFlow</a>
with standard parameters which was then read into R via the <a
href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/">Seurat</a> package.</p>
<p>Looking at the read counts and number of features output from scFlow
revealed that 3 of the donors, and the vascular fraction from a fourth
donor, were of poor quality and so they were excluded from downstream
analysis. PCA was performed and 35 dimensions were used to find
nearest-neighbors and a resolution of 0.6 was used to find clusters via
Seurat. UMAP was computed with the same 35 dimensions. Cluster markers
were found using genes with at least 20% of cells in a cluster
expressing them, and a minimum log foldchange of 0.5, again via
Seurat.</p>
<p>Differences in celltype proportions between cases and controls were
examined with the <a
href="https://github.com/phipsonlab/speckle">speckle</a> R package. It
leverages biological replication to obtain measures of variability of
cell type proportion estimates and uses empirical Bayes to stabilize
variance estimates by borrowing information across cell types.</p>
