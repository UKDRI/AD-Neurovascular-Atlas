# Project overview

This project is using single-nuclear RNA sequencing data to investigate the blood brain barrier in Alzheimer's disease.

There are 20 cases and 20 controls with two cell populations sequenced for a total of 80 samples.

## Data

The are three sets of data.

Set 1 contains the first 12 donors, 24 samples (12x P - parenchymal and 12x V - vascular fraction), which are independently sequenced of Set_2 (the remaining 16 samples from 8 donors).
The sequencing was performed for set 1 initially in Oxford, but there were some issues with index hopping and cleaning the data did not seem to work too well.
So Set 1 was re-sequenced in Cardiff and the folder is: 211008_A00748_0157_AHT7TJDSX2_fastq_L2_3_4

For set 2 the data was sequenced initially on one Illumina lane, but then more lanes were added for better coverage.

The last set is another bath of 40 samples from 20 donors.
